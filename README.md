# Melanoma detection using CNN
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma
- reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- 75% of skin cancer deaths


## Conclusions
- Model 1 with epoch 3 has accuracy using cnn
- Model 2 with epoch 20 is high overfitting
- Model 3 with epoch 20 and added dropout and normilization increased the accuracy by doing augmentation
- Model 4 with epoch 30 increased validation dataset accuracy because of augmentation


## Technologies Used
- tensorflow 
- keras
- pandas
- matplotlib.pyplot
- Jupyter
